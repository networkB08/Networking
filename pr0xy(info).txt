[Analyses]
---------------------------------------------------------------
1. We created a sniff.py python file to sniff all the TCP packets.
2. Now we will create an interpreter to interprete a set of policies 
for security of the network.
3. We will analyse like :
i. A traffic will be malicious if it is requesting for SSH info if it is running 
over HTTP or HTTPS (rule1)
ii. We will create a set of security rules to make follow by our 
*pr0xy*

[proxying or firewall tactics]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. We will create a pr0xy.py which will get the analyses from sniff.py if any 
packet is malicous according to the security policies , we will discard that network 
connection.
2. IT will have all the admining functions to see what packets are getting discarded
as it is open source , and it doesnt send any of the user data anywhere as u
can see everything is tranparent in Open Source , and we will using OSINT security
tactics from CISCO SecureX , Snort , Shodan.io and other platforms
